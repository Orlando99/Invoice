This package has to be updated manually when new updates are released. I 
don't know anywhere where Parse actually announces new versions, and 
sometimes I forget to check.

If you notice the package is out-of-date:

- fork this and create a new branch
- download the latest version (you can use `download_latest.sh` if you 
have `wget`)
- commit
- `bower version [version number from parse.js]`
- push with tags (`git push --tags`)
- send a PR
